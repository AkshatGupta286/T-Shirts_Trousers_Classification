## T-Shirts_Trousers_Classification

### Overview
In this work, we are comparing Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for classification of images as T-Shirts or Trousers. No built-in libraries like scikit-learn are used for writing the algorithms and all agorithms are written from scratch. We are using Mean and Standard Deviation as the features for training the models.

### Installation

```
# from environment.yml
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Results

We could achieve an accuracy of **83.15%** using **Naive Bayes Classifier**  
We could achiece an accuracy of **92.2%** using **Logistic Regression CLassifier**
