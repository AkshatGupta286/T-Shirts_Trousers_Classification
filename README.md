## T-Shirts Trousers Classification

### Overview
In this work, I have compared Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression for classification of images as T-Shirts or Trousers. No built-in libraries like scikit-learn are used for writing the algorithms and all agorithms are written from scratch. I have used Mean and Standard Deviation as the features for training the models.

### Installation
To use this repo, create a conda environment using ```environment.yml```

```
# from environment.yml
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

### Results

I could achieve an accuracy of **83.15%** using **Naive Bayes Classifier**  
I could achiece an accuracy of **92.2%** using **Logistic Regression CLassifier**
